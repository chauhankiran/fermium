# Fermium

A simple CRM system in Node

### Getting Started

Running the application locally is quite simple with following steps.

1. Clone the repository.
  ```bash
  $ git clone git@github.com:chauhankiran/fermium.git
  ```
2. Go inside the cloned repository or folder.
  ```bash
  $ cd fermium
  ```
3. Install the dependencies.
  ```bash
  $ npm i
  ```
4. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
  ```bash
  $ mv .env.example .env
  ```
5. Fill the appropriate values in `.env` files. For `COOKIE_SECRET` and `SESSION_SECRET`, add random string value with at least 64 characters long. Add same random string to both `COOKIE_SECRET` and `SESSION_SECRET`.
6. Run the database migration.
  ```bash
  $ npx sequelize db:migrate
  ```
7. Start the application.
  ```bash
  $ npm start
  ```
8. If everything goes fine, you should have the running application at http://localhost:3000. Go ahead and create an account by visiting the register page and explore the application! Happy hacking!


### Folder Structure

The folder structure is intentionally simple and usual for collaboration.

| folder      | description |

| controllers | "C" of MVC. Business logic resides currently here. |
| middleware  | A collection of files used as middleware. |
